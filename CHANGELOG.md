# v2.0.0
- Brightened several parts of the suit (helmet most noticeable)
- Reduced normal intensity to make the suit smoother (I think the original had no normal map at all, but it looks good for minor details)
- Should look almost indistinguishable from the teaser footage! I think this is the best we'll get unless Zeekerss releases the original files
# v1.2.2
- Visors now use their original, authentic color (turns out, there is a leftover material in the game with the right color value)
# v1.2.1
- Made visor less saturated
# v1.2.0
- Updated for v50
- Tweaked the suit texture (now has cyan visors for authenticity)
# v1.1.0
- New configuration setting to make the suit unlockable after you purchase all other suits
- Fixed multiple copies of the suit spawning after you get fired
# v1.0.3
- Renamed suit to fit a little more in-universe
- Hopefully fixed all the multiplayer sync issues (empty suit rack, two orange suits, etc.)
# v1.0.2
- Tweaked the suit texture (little more pale)
# v1.0.1
- Classic suit is no longer available on challenge moons
# v1.0.0
