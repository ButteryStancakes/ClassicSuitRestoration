# Classic Suit Restoration
Lethal Company plugin.

Adds an additional suit similar to the tan suits in the game's announcement teaser.

This is unfortunately just a mock-up, as the official texture files are not publicly available anywhere, to my knowledge.

Everyone in the lobby needs to have the mod downloaded or it will cause issues.
